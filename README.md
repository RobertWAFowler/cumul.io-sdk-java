# Cumul.io API

You can use this Java project to interact with the [Cumul.io](https://cumul.io) API in order to create, modify or delete datasets, dashboards or push new data into the platform in a programmatic way.

## Usage

See the `CumulioExample` class for examples how to create datasets or push data into the platform (triggering real-time dashboard updates).
See the `EmbeddingExample` class to see an example of how to use the API to securely embed dashboards in a web page (with serverside pre-filtering of the data that the end-user can query).

## Documentation

The API documentation (available services and methods) can be found [here](http://documentation.cumul.io/apidocs.html).
